# lemon2gf

<a href="https://github.com/cunger/lemon2gf">lemon2gf</a> is a Python script that transforms an ontology and one or more attached lemon lexica into a <a href="http://www.grammaticalframework.org">Grammatical Framework</a> (GF) grammar.

lemon2gf can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/cunger/lemon2gf).

## Architecture

lemon2gf consists of two steps: mapping the ontology to an abstract syntax, and mapping a corresponding lexicon to a concrete syntax.

### Core grammar

The generated GF grammar builds on a core that specifies the following categories:

    cat 
       Class;
       Individual Class;
       Statement;

In addition, it comprises domain-independent expressions and constructions, such as determiners, coordination and negation, that will not be provided in a domain lexicon. 


### Mapping an ontology to an abstract syntax

* Classes are mapped to constants of category `Class`, e.g. the class `dbpedia:Mountain` becomes:

    `Mountain : Class;`

* Individuals are mapped to constants with their RDF type as type parameter, e.g. `resource:Nanga_Parbat` becomes:

    `Nanga_Parbat : Individual Mountain;`

* Object properties are mapped to functions from individuals of the domain type to individuals of the range type and have the return type `Statement`, e.g. `dbpedia:firstAscentPerson` with domain `dbpedia:Mountain` and range `dbpedia:Person` becomes:

    `firstAscentPerson : Individual Mountain -> Individual Person -> Statement;`

    If a property does not specify a domain or range, `owl:Thing` is assumed as default.

* Datatypes are mapped to categories (keeping the prefix), e.g. `xsd:double` becomes:

     `cat xsddouble;`

* Datatype properties are mapped to functions from individuals of the domain type to the range category, again with return type `Statement`, e.g. `dbpedia:elevation` with domain `dbpedia:Place` and range `xsd:double` becomes:

    `elevation : Individual Place -> xsddouble -> Statement;`

Additionally, for each class a list of all superclasses are collected and mapped to according GF judgements that allow for simple type coercions, e.g. coercing `Individual Mountain` to `Individual Place`. 


### Mapping a lexicon to a concrete syntax

First, all senses are collected. In case a sense does not refer to an ontology URI, for example either refers to a URI defined in the lexicon itself, or is composed of several subsenses, then the abstract syntax is extended with according GF functions or constants. Currently, lemon2gf covers the basic OWL constructs such as `owl:unionOf`, `owl:intersectionOf`, `owl:complementOf`, `owl:propertyChainAxiom` and `owl:inverseOf`.

Subsequently, for each sense all lexical entries denoting this sense are retrieved from the lexicon, together with all relevant morphosyntactic information. On the basis of its syntactic frame or, if no frame is specified, its part of speech, templates for GF linearization judgements are instantiated. 
For example, the following two lexical entries...

      :mountain a lemon:LexicalEntry ;
          lexinfo:partOfSpeech lexinfo:noun ;
          lemon:canonicalForm [ lemon:writtenRep "mountain"@en ] ;
          lemon:sense [ lemon:reference dbpedia:Mountain ] .

      :peak a lemon:LexicalEntry ;
          lexinfo:partOfSpeech lexinfo:noun ;
          lemon:canonicalForm [ lemon:writtenRep "peak"@en ;
                                lexinfo:number lexinfo:singular ] ;
          lemon:otherForm     [ lemon:writtenRep "peaks"@en ;
                                lexinfo:number lexinfo:plural ];
          lemon:sense [ lemon:reference dbpedia:Mountain ] .

...are converted into the following linearization judgements:

    lin Mountain = variants { mkCN mountain_N; mkCN peak_N };

    oper
        mountain_N = mkN "mountain";
        peak_N = mkN "peak" "peaks";

lemon2gf covers the most common <a href="http://www.lexinfo.net/ontology/2.0/lexinfo.owl">LexInfo</a> parts of speech and frames, and can be easily extended.


## Example 

* Ontology (ATIS flight travel domain, developed in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/portdial2/">PortDial</a> project): <a href="lemon2gf/travelDomain.owl">travelDomain.owl</a>, <a href="lemon2gf/travelDomain_ABox.ttl">travelDomain_ABox.ttl</a>
* Lexicon: <a href="lemon2gf/travelDomain_en.ttl">travelDomain\_en.ttl</a>, <a href="lemon2gf/travelDomain_ABox_en.ttl">travelDomain\_ABox\_en.ttl</a>
* Generated GF grammars: <a href="lemon2gf/TravelDomain.gf">TravelDomain.gf</a>, <a href="lemon2gf/TravelDomainEng.gf">TravelDomainEng.gf</a>
